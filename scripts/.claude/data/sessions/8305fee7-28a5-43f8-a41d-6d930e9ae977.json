    "sorry the CLI broke. i think the one without the testdir reference got through and did not know the word",
    "inow please try @agent-general-purpose and include the @ testdir in your query",
    "i created @testdir/words.md \n\nnow if you do the same test but with the only description being \"add claude to the list of words\". ",
    "now if you do the same thing again, the query being \"Tell me about the words in @testdir/ \". please ultrathink about what this tells us and make sure you give the agent the exact query i showed you",
    "I do think this actually is okay. Since we added the folder as \"included\" with the @-syntax it probably should \"re-read the claude file on entry\" always. But if you do the same thing but @-syntax the words.md file i hope he \"reads\" the file anyway so please try it out. the same thing again but testdir/words.md as included instead of only the directory",
    "now please try again and reference the words.md exactly like last message"
