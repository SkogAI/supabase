    "hello claude! can you check the latest claude comment on PR #62 it was made with @.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml and i'm looking for critique. i'm looking in particular if it should be left for copilot in general unless explicitly asked for a deeper look",
    "Now what is the current triggers on the workflow itself? A manual run-command to make this a \"review\" before becoming a PR + \"manually ask to review this PR\" would probably be more fitting. is this alternatives that we can change to?",
    "this is not available for our workflow solutions: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review ?",
    "All that focus on a review as well as the @.claude/commands/issue.md \ncompare that to PR #61",
    "Now can you see the actual workflow for both #61 and #62? Because if you compare the two results/actual PR's then something big is missing in our /issue command",
    "no that is not it. we just removed all the useless \"checks\" since they are not needed. plus those checks are ran after creation anyway so we would create a \"/pr\" which handles the aftermath if needed instead.\n\ni ask again, did you compare the actual results/PR that got created by the two?",
    "now normally that would be how we do it but it would be insane overkill for something which honestly should be done anyway. i will check up some SkogAI-solutions to this problem - because a README.md should not be needed to explicitly check when asked to change something like this"
