    "hello claude. im testing some worktree automation. can you check the git state currently with extra focus on worktrees and the branches created?",
    "crap, is it the currently checked out branch a worktree normally gets created from?",
    "is there any way to set any default via git?",
    "so that is a no then :/ feels like a waste to have a \"always leave this at develop branch\"-repo.. wait it works from head? do it fetch before creating the tree or how do that work?",
    "fuck.. any way to edit the worktree itself after creation then?",
    "and hooks do not exist for this?"
