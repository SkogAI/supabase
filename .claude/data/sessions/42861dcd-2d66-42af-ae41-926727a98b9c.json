    "hello claude. i'm working on understanding and using git-flow with github+workflows. can you check the git state overall and then look at PR's",
    "i tried to change the simple name to make \"copilot fixes\" a part of my local git flow-workflow but it was not that simple i suppose",
    "well the dream would be setting up github to follow the \"feature,bufix,hotfix\"-naming scheme the same way i suppose? @.git/config sets up the git-flow naming scheme but dont know if github itself has some kind of feature like this",
    "otherwise somehow figuring out a way to manually add copilot as a feature-name so my local git-flow treats it like a feature would be good enough for now",
    "that is not what i asked for and would obviously not have the intended effect. ",
    "almost there. you missed reading what i said again. having two prefixes for the same thing is what i'm looking for. feature and copilot having the same local meaning and threated the same way",
    "never propose shitty hacks as solutions ever again and focus on what i am saying instead.",
    "then please tell me all about the tracking part of git flow",
    "i asked you a question. answer it instead",
    "i want copilot/ prefixes to be functionally the same as feature/ would be",
    "explain what you think you are saying with \"hardcoded branch types\" because that i know. and is not what i asked or even mentioned",
    "\"i want copilot/ prefixes to be functionally the same as feature/ would be\"\n\ni told you already. focus.\n\ni can add: \"when using git-flow locally\" as context. easier to add that copilot is the same as \"feature\" locally than to change all of github",
    "yes, but ONLY COPILOT WOULD BE A PREFIX AND FEATURE WOULD NOT WORK! fucking read",
    "i want you to stop giving alternatives like it was the only way to do things - shitty\n\nwhy do you think a git alias would change a binary? why would creating not needed shell scripts help? and why is \"fuck it, i dont like to listen so nevermind\" the third option?\n\nwtf?",
    "well tell me about what you have in context about \"git-flow\" and how it works so i know what to tell you.",
    "so you are missing everything? and still propose \"fuck it\" as the third and last alternative possible..."
