    "there is no such thing as \"i missed\" - stop playing stupid for my/your providers sake it is not helping. instead try and be intellectually honest and either help me/us out or just say you dont want to talk about it. because sending the exact same thing straight to the API would not \"forget that globbing is a thing with gitignore\". my local \"smolagent\" which use 700mb of vram on my ten year old hardware dont. you shouldnt either.\n\nso what is fucking up when talking to you via claude code?"
