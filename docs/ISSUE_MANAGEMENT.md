## Creating Issues

### Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/SkogAI/supabase/issues/new/choose
2. Select the appropriate template
3. Fill out all required fields
4. Add relevant labels
5. Assign to team members (if known)
6. Submit the issue

### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Create a bug report
gh issue create --repo SkogAI/supabase --web

# Create with specific template
gh issue create \
  --repo SkogAI/supabase \
  --title "Your title" \
  --body "Your description" \
  --label "bug"

# List issues
gh issue list --repo SkogAI/supabase

# View specific issue
gh issue view 123 --repo SkogAI/supabase
```

### Using the Issue Creation Script

We provide a script to create all the initial project tracking issues:

```bash
# Run the script (requires gh CLI authentication)
./scripts/create-issues.sh

10. Security Audit and Hardening
11. Backup and Recovery Procedures
12. Monitoring and Alerting Setup

## Project Board Integration

Consider using GitHub Projects to visualize issue status:

1. Create a project board
2. Add columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
3. Add issues to the board
4. Move cards as work progresses
5. Filter by labels, assignees, milestones

## Issue Metrics

Track these metrics to improve workflow:
- Time to triage (creation ‚Üí assignment)
- Time to first response
- Time to resolution
- Issue velocity (opened vs closed)
- Bug/feature ratio

## Best Practices

### For Reporters
1. **Search first** - Check if issue already exists
2. **Use templates** - Provide all required information
3. **Be specific** - Include details, steps, context
4. **One issue per problem** - Don't combine unrelated issues
5. **Follow up** - Respond to questions and updates

### For Assignees
1. **Update status** - Keep issue current with progress
2. **Ask questions** - Clarify requirements early
3. **Break down large issues** - Create sub-tasks if needed
4. **Document decisions** - Record why choices were made
5. **Test thoroughly** - Verify issue is resolved

### For Maintainers
1. **Triage regularly** - Review new issues daily/weekly
2. **Set priorities** - Help team focus on important work
3. **Provide context** - Share domain knowledge
4. **Close stale issues** - Archive inactive or obsolete issues
