# MCP Implementation Summary

## Purpose

High-level overview of the complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation for AI agent database connectivity.

## Implementation Status

- [status] ✅ **Architecture** - Complete MCP server design documented
- [status] ✅ **Connection Pooling** - Optimized for AI workloads
- [status] ✅ **Authentication** - Multiple methods implemented
- [status] ✅ **Session Mode** - IPv4 persistent agents configured
- [status] ✅ **Transaction Mode** - Serverless agents supported
- [status] ✅ **Monitoring** - Comprehensive observability setup
- [status] ✅ **Troubleshooting** - Complete diagnostic guides
- [status] ✅ **Security** - SSL/TLS and RLS enforced

## Core Components Implemented

- [component] MCP Server Layer with authentication
- [component] Supavisor Session Pooler (port 5432)
- [component] Supavisor Transaction Pooler (port 6543)
- [component] Direct IPv6 connections
- [component] Dedicated pooler support (paid tiers)
- [component] Connection health checks
- [component] Monitoring and alerting

## Supported Agent Types

- [supported] Persistent AI agents with direct/session connections
