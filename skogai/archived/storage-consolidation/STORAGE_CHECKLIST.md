# Storage Setup Checklist

Quick checklist to verify your storage buckets are correctly configured and working.

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### 1. Apply Migration

```bash
# Reset database to apply all migrations including storage
npm run db:reset

# Or apply manually
supabase db reset
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì Applying migration 20251006095457_configure_storage_buckets.sql
‚úì Storage buckets configured successfully
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run storage test suite
supabase db execute --file tests/storage_test_suite.sql
```

Expected output:
```
TEST 1: Verifying storage buckets are created...
PASS: All storage buckets created with correct visibility

TEST 2: Verifying file size limits...
PASS: File size limits configured correctly

TEST 3: Verifying MIME type restrictions...
PASS: MIME type restrictions configured correctly

TEST 4: Verifying storage RLS policies...
PASS: Storage RLS policies configured correctly

All tests passed!
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Database Configuration

- [ ] Migration file exists: `supabase/migrations/20251006095457_configure_storage_buckets.sql`
- [ ] Migration has been applied (check with `supabase db status`)
- [ ] Test suite passes: `tests/storage_test_suite.sql`

### Buckets Created

- [ ] `avatars` bucket exists (public, 5MB limit)
- [ ] `public-assets` bucket exists (public, 10MB limit)
- [ ] `user-files` bucket exists (private, 50MB limit)

### RLS Policies

- [ ] 4 policies on avatars bucket (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] 4 policies on public-assets bucket (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] 4 policies on user-files bucket (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Total: 12 storage policies configured

### File Restrictions

- [ ] avatars: 5MB limit, images only
- [ ] public-assets: 10MB limit, multiple types
- [ ] user-files: 50MB limit, documents/images/archives

### Documentation

- [ ] `docs/STORAGE.md` - Complete usage guide
- [ ] `docs/STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- [ ] `examples/storage/` - Working code examples
- [ ] README.md updated with storage section

## üß™ Manual Testing

### Test 1: Upload Avatar (Public Bucket)

```bash
cd examples/storage
npm install
node avatar-upload.js
```

Expected: Can list avatars (if any exist)

### Test 2: Upload Private File

```bash
node file-upload.js
```

Expected: Can list user files (if any exist)

### Test 3: Upload Public Asset

```bash
node public-assets.js
```

Expected: Can list public assets and get public URLs

### Test 4: Verify in Studio

1. Open Supabase Studio: http://localhost:8000
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Verify buckets:
   - ‚úì avatars (public)
   - ‚úì public-assets (public)
   - ‚úì user-files (private)

### Test 5: Upload via Studio

1. Select `avatars` bucket
2. Try to upload an image (should work)
3. Try to upload a PDF (should fail - wrong MIME type)
4. Try to upload a 10MB image (should fail - size limit)

## üîí Security Testing

### Test User Isolation

```javascript
// Test that users can't access other users' files
const userA = 'user-id-a';
const userB = 'user-id-b';

// User A uploads file
await supabase.storage.from('user-files').upload(`${userA}/doc.pdf`, file);

// User B tries to access (should fail)
const { error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('user-files')
  .download(`${userA}/doc.pdf`); // Error: RLS policy violation
```

### Test MIME Type Restrictions

```javascript
// Try uploading PDF to avatars bucket (should fail)
await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload('user/doc.pdf', pdfFile);
// Error: File type not allowed
```

### Test Size Limits

```javascript
// Try uploading 6MB image to avatars (should fail)
await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload('user/big.jpg', largeFile);
// Error: File size exceeds limit
```

## üìä Verification Commands

### Check Buckets

```sql
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit 
FROM storage.buckets 
ORDER BY name;
```

Expected output:
```
id             | name          | public | file_size_limit
---------------+---------------+--------+-----------------
avatars        | avatars       | true   | 5242880
public-assets  | public-assets | true   | 10485760
user-files     | user-files    | false  | 52428800
```

### Check Policies

```sql
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd,
    CASE 
        WHEN definition LIKE '%avatars%' THEN 'avatars'
        WHEN definition LIKE '%public-assets%' THEN 'public-assets'
        WHEN definition LIKE '%user-files%' THEN 'user-files'
    END as bucket
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
  AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY bucket, cmd;
```

Expected: 12 rows (4 per bucket)

### Check MIME Types

```sql
SELECT id, allowed_mime_types 
FROM storage.buckets 
ORDER BY id;
```

Expected: Each bucket has appropriate MIME types array

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails

```bash
# Check migration status
supabase db status

# View error details
supabase db reset --debug
```

### Tests Fail

```bash
# Reset and rerun
supabase db reset
supabase db execute --file tests/storage_test_suite.sql
```

### Can't Upload Files

1. Check authentication (user must be signed in)
2. Verify file path format: `{user_id}/{filename}`
3. Check MIME type is allowed
4. Verify file size within limit
5. Check RLS policies in Studio

### Policy Errors

```bash
# View storage policies
supabase db execute --sql "SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects'"

# Check if storage.foldername exists
supabase db execute --sql "SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'foldername'"
```

## üìö Next Steps

Once all checks pass:

1. ‚úÖ Review [docs/STORAGE.md](./STORAGE.md) for usage patterns
2. ‚úÖ Integrate storage in your application
3. ‚úÖ Test with real user authentication
4. ‚úÖ Monitor storage usage in production
5. ‚úÖ Set up backup policies if needed

## üéØ Production Readiness

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Security testing verified
- [ ] File organization strategy defined
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Team trained on storage patterns
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
