## Observation Categories Extracted

[category] Commands - CLI commands and usage patterns documented #observations #cli
[category] Symptoms - Problem indicators and error patterns captured #observations #troubleshooting
[category] Solutions - Fixes and workarounds documented #observations #solutions
[category] Workflows - Step-by-step procedures established #observations #procedures
[category] Configurations - Settings and options documented #observations #config
[category] Security - Best practices and anti-patterns identified #observations #security
[category] Architecture - Components and design patterns captured #observations #design

## Patterns Established

[pattern] Consistent observation format: `[category] description #tags` #methodology #standards
[pattern] Hierarchical organization by topic area #methodology #structure
[pattern] WikiLink relations between related documents #methodology #navigation
[pattern] YAML frontmatter with project, tags, type, permalink #methodology #metadata
[pattern] Semantic tags for searchability and filtering #methodology #taxonomy

## Quality Improvements

[quality] Enhanced searchability through semantic observations #improvement #search
[quality] Improved navigation via cross-references #improvement #navigation
[quality] Established consistent formatting standards #improvement #consistency
[quality] Created logical hierarchical organization #improvement #structure
[quality] Enabled multi-path access via tags #improvement #taxonomy

## Tools and Methodology

[tool] Basic Memory MCP tools for all knowledge base operations #tooling #mcp
[tool] TodoWrite for tracking migration progress #tooling #tracking
[method] Read original docs, extract observations, create semantic notes #methodology #process
[method] Add descriptive tags for searchability #methodology #tagging
[method] Create WikiLink relations to related documents #methodology #linking
[method] Organize into hierarchical folder structure #methodology #organization

## Challenges Addressed

[challenge] Large documents required extensive observation extraction #solved #scale
[solution] Established clear patterns early in session for consistency #methodology #standards
[challenge] Maintaining consistent observation categories across documents #solved #consistency
[solution] Used consistent category prefixes throughout migration #methodology #standards
[challenge] Determining appropriate folder hierarchy for organization #solved #organization
[solution] Organized by logical groupings (security, storage, devops) #methodology #structure

## Impact on Project

[impact] Development workflows now fully documented and searchable #benefit #development
[impact] Troubleshooting knowledge instantly accessible #benefit #support
[impact] Architecture decisions preserved for future reference #benefit #documentation
