# Project Architecture

## Overview

Comprehensive system architecture for a production-ready Supabase backend featuring PostgreSQL database, Edge Functions, Storage, and complete CI/CD pipeline.

## Core Components

- [component] Supabase Platform - Unified backend-as-a-service
- [component] PostgreSQL Database - Primary data store with advanced features
- [component] Edge Functions - Serverless compute using Deno runtime
- [component] Storage Service - File storage with RLS policies
- [component] Authentication Service - Multi-method user authentication
- [component] Realtime Service - WebSocket-based live updates
- [component] API Gateway - Kong-based routing and security

## Database Architecture

- [design] Schema organized into public, auth, and storage
- [design] Migration-based version control for schema changes
- [design] Row Level Security for fine-grained access control
- [design] Automated triggers for timestamp management
- [design] Foreign key relationships with cascading deletes
- [design] Indexes on frequently queried columns

## Security Model

- [security] Three-tier role system (anon, authenticated, service_role)
- [security] JWT token-based authentication
- [security] RLS policies enforced at database layer
- [security] Service role bypasses RLS for admin operations
- [security] Client never receives service_role credentials

## Edge Functions Design

- [design] Deno 2.x runtime for TypeScript/JavaScript
- [design] Shared utilities in _shared/ directory
- [design] Environment variables for secrets
- [design] CORS configuration per function
- [design] Auto-scaling based on demand

## Storage Architecture

- [design] Three bucket types: avatars, public-assets, user-files
- [design] User-scoped path structure: {bucket}/{user_id}/filename
- [design] RLS policies for access control
- [design] MIME type and size restrictions per bucket
- [design] CDN integration for performance

## CI/CD Pipeline Design

- [design] GitHub Actions for automation
- [design] Automated testing on pull requests
- [design] Migration validation before deployment
- [design] Type generation on schema changes
- [design] Automatic deployment on merge to main

## Design Decisions

- [decision] Chose Supabase for rapid development with auto-generated APIs
- [decision] PostgreSQL for mature, reliable database with rich features
- [decision] Deno for edge functions due to security and modern tooling
- [decision] RLS for database-layer security that can't be bypassed
- [decision] TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- [decision] Docker for consistent local development environment

## Performance Considerations

- [optimization] Connection pooling via Supavisor
- [optimization] Database indexes on foreign keys and query columns
- [optimization] CDN caching for static assets
- [optimization] Edge function cold start optimization
- [optimization] Partial indexes for filtered queries

## Scalability Strategy

- [scaling] Vertical database scaling as primary strategy
- [scaling] Read replicas for high-traffic scenarios
- [scaling] Edge functions auto-scale globally
- [scaling] Storage with multi-region replication
