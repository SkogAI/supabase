[area] Architecture (2 docs) - Project overview, system architecture #coverage #architecture

## Knowledge Graph Structure

[structure] Hierarchical organization: concepts → guides → project #organization #hierarchy
[structure] Semantic observations with category tags #organization #metadata
[structure] WikiLink relations between related documents #organization #linking
[structure] YAML frontmatter with project, tags, type, permalink #organization #standards
[structure] Consistent observation format: `[category] description #tags` #organization #pattern

## Observation Patterns Established

[pattern] Command format: `[command] \`command-text\` description #tags` #pattern #commands
[pattern] Symptom format: `[symptom] Problem description #tags` #pattern #troubleshooting
[pattern] Solution format: `[solution] Fix description with command or action #tags` #pattern #solutions
[pattern] Workflow format: `[workflow] Step-by-step procedure #tags` #pattern #procedures
[pattern] Configuration format: `[config] Setting description with value #tags` #pattern #settings
[pattern] Security format: `[bestpractice] Do this / [antipattern] Don't do this #tags` #pattern #security

## Cross-Reference Patterns

[linking] Core concepts linked to related guides #relations #concepts
[linking] Guides reference related concepts and other guides #relations #guides
[linking] Project docs reference all relevant concepts and guides #relations #project
[linking] Troubleshooting links to specific workflow sections #relations #support
[linking] Architecture docs link to component-specific guides #relations #architecture

## Documentation Quality Improvements

[improvement] Searchable observations enable keyword discovery #quality #searchability
[improvement] Semantic categories organize information logically #quality #organization
[improvement] Cross-references facilitate navigation #quality #navigation
[improvement] Consistent formatting improves readability #quality #consistency
[improvement] Tag system enables filtering and grouping #quality #taxonomy

## Migration Approach

[approach] Read original markdown documentation files #methodology #input
[approach] Extract semantic observations with categories #methodology #extraction
[approach] Add descriptive tags for searchability #methodology #tagging
[approach] Create WikiLink relations to related documents #methodology #linking
[approach] Organize into hierarchical folder structure #methodology #organization
[approach] Write notes using Basic Memory MCP tools #methodology #tools

## Tools and Commands Used

[tool] `mcp__skogai-memory__read_note()` to read original docs #tools #read
[tool] `mcp__skogai-memory__write_note()` to create semantic notes #tools #write
[tool] `mcp__skogai-memory__edit_note()` to update existing notes #tools #edit
[tool] `mcp__skogai-memory__list_directory()` to explore structure #tools #navigation
[tool] `TodoWrite` to track migration progress #tools #tracking

## Challenges Encountered

[challenge] Large documents require extensive observation extraction #challenge #scale
[challenge] Maintaining consistent observation categories #challenge #consistency
[challenge] Determining appropriate folder hierarchy #challenge #organization
[challenge] Balancing detail vs. conciseness in observations #challenge #content
[solution] Established clear patterns early in session #solution #methodology
