# RLS Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) implementation for this Supabase project.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RLS Policies Migration

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251005053101_enhanced_rls_policies.sql`

This migration adds comprehensive, role-specific RLS policies:

#### Service Role Policies
- Full admin access to all tables
- Used for backend operations, cron jobs, admin functions
- Bypasses all RLS restrictions

#### Authenticated User Policies
- Can view all public profiles
- Can only create/update/delete their own profiles
- Can view published posts + their own drafts
- Can only create/update/delete their own posts
- Cannot access or modify other users' private data

#### Anonymous User Policies
- Read-only access to all public profiles
- Read-only access to published posts only
- Cannot view drafts
- Cannot create, update, or delete any data

### 2. Documentation

#### RLS Policy Guide (`docs/RLS_POLICIES.md`)
Comprehensive 10KB+ guide covering:
- Policy patterns and use cases
- Role-based access control
- Common policy examples
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Naming conventions
- Migration history

#### RLS Testing Guide (`docs/RLS_TESTING.md`)
Detailed 17KB+ testing guide covering:
- Local testing procedures
- Testing different user contexts (service, authenticated, anonymous)
- Automated testing examples
- CI/CD integration
- Common test scenarios
- JavaScript/TypeScript test examples
- Troubleshooting testing issues

### 3. Automated Test Suite

#### Test Suite (`tests/rls_test_suite.sql`)
Comprehensive 11KB+ SQL test script that validates:
- ✅ RLS is enabled on all public tables
- ✅ Service role has full access
- ✅ Authenticated users can view all public data
- ✅ Authenticated users can only modify own data
- ✅ Anonymous users have read-only access
- ✅ Anonymous users cannot modify any data
- ✅ Cross-user access is properly restricted
- ✅ Service role can bypass restrictions

#### Test Documentation (`tests/README.md`)
Complete guide on:
- How to run the test suite
- Expected output
- Troubleshooting test failures
- CI/CD integration
- Writing custom tests

### 4. Project Integration

- ✅ Added `test:rls` npm script for easy testing
- ✅ Updated README.md with RLS documentation links
- ✅ Added RLS testing to development workflow
- ✅ Integrated with existing CI/CD pipelines

## 📊 Policy Coverage

### Profiles Table
- **Service Role**: 1 policy (full access)
- **Authenticated**: 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT own, UPDATE own, DELETE own)
- **Anonymous**: 1 policy (SELECT only)
- **Total**: 6 policies

### Posts Table
- **Service Role**: 1 policy (full access)
- **Authenticated**: 4 policies (SELECT published+own drafts, INSERT own, UPDATE own, DELETE own)
- **Anonymous**: 1 policy (SELECT published only)
- **Total**: 6 policies

## 🔒 Security Model

### Data Access Matrix

| Operation | Service Role | Authenticated (Own) | Authenticated (Other) | Anonymous |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| **View Profiles** | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| **Create Profile** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Update Profile** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Delete Profile** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **View Published Posts** | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| **View Draft Posts** | ✅ All | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Create Post** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Update Post** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| **Delete Post** | ✅ Any | ✅ Own | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Start Supabase
npm run db:start

# Reset database with migrations and seed data
npm run db:reset

# Run RLS test suite
npm run test:rls
```

### Expected Output

```
================================================================================

TEST SUITE COMPLETE - All tests passed!
```

## 📋 Checklist - All Tasks Complete

### Issue Requirements
- ✅ Create migration for enabling RLS on tables
- ✅ Add policies for authenticated users
- ✅ Add policies for anonymous access where needed
- ✅ Add admin/service role policies
- ✅ Document RLS policy patterns
- ✅ Add RLS testing guidelines

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ RLS enabled on all public tables
- ✅ Policies are tested and working correctly
- ✅ Documentation explains policy logic
- ✅ No accidental data exposure

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Development
1. Review the RLS policy documentation: `docs/RLS_POLICIES.md`
2. Run the test suite to verify policies: `npm run test:rls`
3. Add new tables? Follow patterns in existing migration
4. Need custom policies? See examples in documentation

### For Production
1. Review all policies before deployment
2. Test with real user scenarios
3. Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
4. Regularly audit policy effectiveness

### For New Tables
When adding new tables, follow this checklist:

```sql
-- 1. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Add service role policy
CREATE POLICY "Service role manages your_table"
    ON your_table FOR ALL TO service_role
    USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. Add authenticated policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users view your_table"
    ON your_table FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (/* your condition */);

-- 4. Add anonymous policy (if needed)
CREATE POLICY "Anonymous users view your_table"
    ON your_table FOR SELECT TO anon
    USING (/* your condition */);

-- 5. Document the policies
COMMENT ON TABLE your_table IS 'Description and RLS policy summary';

-- 6. Add to test suite
-- Edit tests/rls_test_suite.sql to include your table
```
