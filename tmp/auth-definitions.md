| **OAuth 2.0**                                                                                           | An authorization framework (not exactly authentication) for delegated access. Lets a user grant a third-party app limited access to their resources without giving credentials.                          | Widely used for “social login” etc., API access delegation. Defines flows (authorization code, implicit, client credentials, etc.). | Supabase uses OAuth flows for “social logins” (Google, GitHub, etc.). ([Supabase][1]) Also has support for PKCE flow for server-side and mobile flows. ([NomadTerrace][2])                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**                                                                               | Identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, used for verifying user identity, getting profile info, standardizing how login is done.                                                                             | Useful for sign-on with standard claims, federated identity, working with identity providers.                                       | Supabase supports “Third-Party Auth Providers” which often are OIDC providers. But Supabase *doesn’t yet* act as a fully compliant OIDC **Provider** in all respects (e.g. custom claims, scopes, token introspection are more limited). ([Logto blog][3])                                                                                                                                |
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**                                                           | A more enterprise / federation-type protocol (XML based) used for Single Sign-On (SSO) in enterprise settings.                                                                                           | Lots of enterprise identity providers (ADFS, Okta, etc.) support SAML; useful in corporate / organizational internal apps.          | Supabase Auth supports SSO via **SAML 2.0**. ([NomadTerrace][2]) There are some limitations (e.g. no single logout (SLO) support yet) noted for the enterprise features. ([SSOJet][4])                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)**                                                                                | A token format / standard to represent claims securely; can be signed (and sometimes encrypted).                                                                                                         | Very broadly used for session tokens, stateless auth, passing identity claims in APIs etc.                                          | Supabase uses JWTs internally: to issue tokens, for authorizing clients, for RLS (Row Level Security). ([Supabase][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**                                                        | Directory / identity store protocol often used on-premises (e.g. Active Directory, corporate LDAP stores).                                                                                               | Useful for organization or enterprise where users are in a directory, need centralized user store & group/role information, etc.    | Supabase doesn’t natively support acting like an LDAP directory or full LDAP binding. It can integrate with external providers, but LDAP isn’t a first class protocol in Supabase. Supabase’s built-in auth is more focused on social providers, email/phone/password, magic link etc. (You can use take-your-own identity provider or federation to incorporate LDAP via other systems). |
| **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)**                                                  | Protocol for automating exchange of user identity information between identity domains / IT systems: e.g. user provisioning, group membership, etc.                                                      | Used in enterprise IAM, when you have to sync users/roles between identity provider and apps / systems.                             | Supabase doesn’t have core SCIM support as far as user/group sync from external directory. Might need custom hooks / integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **WS-Federation / WS-Trust**                                                                            | Older Microsoft-style federation protocols. Used especially in some enterprise / legacy environments.                                                                                                    | Useful when tying in with Windows AD / old Microsoft IAM infrastructure.                                                            | Supabase doesn’t explicitly advertise support for WS-Federation. The main federation / SSO option is SAML or external OIDC or OAuth providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Magic Link / Passwordless Auth**                                                                      | Not exactly a protocol, more a pattern: sending a link or code (often via email or SMS) which when clicked/entered signs in a user without password.                                                     | Very good UX (no password to remember), lower friction. Security depends on link expiry, control etc.                               | Supabase supports magic links (passwordless login) as part of its Auth. ([Supabase][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA / OTP)**                                                       | Adding an extra factor beyond password: e.g. one-time code via SMS or app, authenticator app, hardware keys etc.                                                                                         | Increases security, required for many compliance / higher security applications.                                                    | Supabase supports phone OTP, SMS, etc. It also supports / can integrate with MFA via partners (e.g. Authsignal) for more advanced flows. ([Supabase][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **“Bring Your Own Auth / Identity Provider”** (Auth0, AWS Cognito, Firebase Auth, Keycloak, Logto etc.) | Using a third-party / external identity provider instead of building all auth yourself. These often implement many of the above protocols (OAuth, OIDC, SAML etc.), plus UI, user management, roles etc. | Very common among mid/large apps so you don’t reinvent the wheel. Allows migration, federation, identity centralization.            | Supabase supports using external identity providers / third-party auth providers and “Bring Your Own Auth” options—Auth0, Cognito, Firebase etc. Supabase provides templates / support for translating incoming JWTs to its expected format etc. ([DEV Community][5])                                                                                                                     |
